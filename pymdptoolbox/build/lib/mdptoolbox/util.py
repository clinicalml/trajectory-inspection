"""Markov Decision Process (MDP) Toolbox: ``util`` module
======================================================

The ``util`` module provides functions to check that an MDP is validly
described. There are also functions for working with MDPs while they are being
solved.

Available functions
-------------------

:func:`~mdptoolbox.util.check`
    Check that an MDP is properly defined
:func:`~mdptoolbox.util.checkSquareStochastic`
    Check that a matrix is square and stochastic
:func:`~mdptoolbox.util.getSpan`
    Calculate the span of an array
:func:`~mdptoolbox.util.isNonNegative`
    Check if a matrix has only non-negative elements
:func:`~mdptoolbox.util.isSquare`
    Check if a matrix is square
:func:`~mdptoolbox.util.isStochastic`
    Check if a matrix is row stochastic
